![A Photo Of Me Drinking Coffee](https://github.com/michael-r-may/michael-r-may.github.io/blob/master/me.jpeg?raw=true)

Hi, I’m Michael 👋🏻

I am a mobile software engineer, music lover, coffee lover, beer lover, travelling light, commuter cyclist, fitness runner and general geek about town.

Career wise, it’s gone something like this: Un*x and C then C++ and Windows, then Java and onto J2ME before Symbian (shudder), a smattering of C# and then…iOS! Whoosh…career pivot…square brackets…several well-loved apps later…Swift…and now. It’s been fun, it still is fun, and long may that continue.

I speak at things occasionally (such as UIKonf, NSSpain and KotlinConf) but you have maybe heard me speaking more recently as the co-host of a meet-up called // TODO  (if you live in London!).

You could be for a number of reasons, so let me give you some links to find your way to where you probably want to be;

*// TODO London:*

I am one of the hosts for [// TODO London](http://todo-london.com/), a meet-up for stories from the world of tech that help you to be better at your job, without telling you how to do your job. You should probably join us. :-)

*Apps:*

Whilst I do not have any apps in active development and support, you may have one I wrote earlier. In which case, you can find out more about it here.

*Talks:*

I believe that it is good to get up and speak to our community (when you have something to say). It’s scary, and you don’t always get it right, but sometimes you make a small difference to someone and it’s all worth it.
