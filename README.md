Hi, I‚Äôm Michael üëãüèª

I am a mobile software engineer, music lover, coffee lover, beer lover, travelling light, commuter cyclist, fitness runner and general geek about town.

Career wise, it‚Äôs gone something like this: Un*x and C then C++ and Windows, then Java and onto J2ME before Symbian (shudder), a smattering of C# and then‚Ä¶iOS! Whoosh‚Ä¶career pivot‚Ä¶square brackets‚Ä¶several well-loved apps later‚Ä¶Swift‚Ä¶and now. It‚Äôs been fun, it still is fun, and long may that continue.

You could be for a number of reasons, so let me give you some links to find your way to where you probably want to be;

I am one of the hosts for [// TODO London](http://todo-london.com/), a meet-up for anyone making products for the post-PC world we live in today. We help you to do your job without telling you how to do your job. You should join us.

*Apps:*

Whilst I do not have any apps in active development and support, you may have one I wrote earlier. In which case, you can find out more about it.

*Talks:*

I believe that it is good to get up and speak to our community (when you have something to say). It‚Äôs scary, and you don‚Äôt always get it right, but sometimes you make a small difference to someone and it‚Äôs all worth it.
