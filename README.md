![A Photo Of Me Drinking Coffee](https://github.com/michael-r-may/michael-r-may.github.io/blob/master/me.jpeg?raw=true)

Hi, I‚Äôm Michael üëãüèª

I'm a software engineering manager, music lover, coffee lover, beer lover, travelling light, commuter cyclist, fitness runner and general geek about town.

Career wise, it‚Äôs gone something like this: Un*x and C then C++ and Windows, then Java and onto J2ME before Symbian (shudder), a smattering of C# and then‚Ä¶iOS! Whoosh‚Ä¶career pivot‚Ä¶square brackets‚Ä¶several well-loved apps later - ‚Ä¶Swift‚Ä¶ - and now...managing some amazing people on their journey through the tech world. It‚Äôs been fun, it still is fun, and long may that continue.

I used to speak at things occasionally (such as UIKonf, NSSpain and KotlinConf) or you have maybe heard me speaking more  as the co-host of a meet-up called // TODO  (if you lived in London).

As a manager of managers I have plenty to say, but much less time to prepare talks to share it...fancy a coffee or a pint instead?

*Talks:*

I believe that it is good to get up and speak to our community (when you have something to say). It‚Äôs scary, and you don‚Äôt always get it right, but sometimes you make a small difference to someone and it‚Äôs all worth it.
